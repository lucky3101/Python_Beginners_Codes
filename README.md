# Python_Beginners_Codes

These are the sample codes for Beginners:

1. HealthyProgrammer.py:
    • Write a program which will work between 9am to 5pm daily.
    • After every 15min, a song has to play to remind programmer to drink water.
    • After every 30min, a song has to play to remind programmer to do eyes exercise.
    • After every 45min, a song has to play to remind programmer to do exercise.
    • Once you write Drank for water, EyDone for eyes exercise and ExDone for exercise, song will get stop.
    • Once the song gets stop, it will make a log entry in a file (Eg: You drank water at : Wed May 15 13:01:18 2019)
    • If all the songs is going to play at a same time, then first water song will play. Once it stops, then eyes song will start playing and then exercise song.
    • To play song in the program, you need to use pygame.
